  "description": "This is a weather display app with a twist, it shows you what it recommends you wear based on the current weather conditions. By using the users IP address, it uses an Api to find the current weather conditions in the area. Then using the data like tempurature and sky condition, recommends what to wear based on the wardrobe provided. The user can add or delete different articles of clothing from the database easily, as well as change the tempurature units to and from Celcius and Fahrenheit with a click of a button.",
